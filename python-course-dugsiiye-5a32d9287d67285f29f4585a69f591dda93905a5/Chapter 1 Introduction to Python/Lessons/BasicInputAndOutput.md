In Python, you can use the `input()` function to get input from the user and the `print()` function to display output to the user. Here are some examples:

1. Getting input from the user:

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello, " + name)
```

In this example, we're using the `input()` function to get the user's name, and then using the `print()` function to display a greeting.

2. Displaying output to the user:

```python
print("The answer is", 34)
```

In this example, we're using the `print()` function to display the text "The answer is" followed by the value 34.
