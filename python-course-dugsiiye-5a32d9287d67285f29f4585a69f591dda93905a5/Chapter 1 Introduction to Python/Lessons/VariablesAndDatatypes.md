In Python, a variable is a named location in memory that is used to store a value. Once a variable is defined, it can be used throughout the program to refer to the value stored in that location. Here's an example of defining a variable in Python:

```python
x = 5
```

In this example, we're creating a variable called `x` and assigning it the value `5`.

Python supports several data types, including:

1. Numeric data types: These include integers, floats, and complex numbers.

```python
x = 5 # integer
y = 3.14 # float
z = 2 + 3j # complex number
```

2. Strings: These are sequences of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

```python
s = "Hello, world!"
```

3. Booleans: These are logical values that can be either True or False.

```python
a = True
b = False
```

4. Lists: These are ordered collections of values, which can be of different data types.

```python
l = [1, 2, "three", True]
```

5. Tuples: These are similar to lists, but they are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once they are created.

```python
t = (1, 2, "three", True)
```

6. Sets: These are unordered collections of unique values.

```python
s = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

7. Dictionaries: These are collections of key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a value.

```python
d = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
```

Python is a dynamically typed language, which means that the data type of a variable is determined at runtime based on the value assigned to it. This also means that a variable can be reassigned to a value of a different data type.
