Built-in functions and methods are both pre-defined functionalities in Python that can be used to perform certain operations. However, they differ in their syntax and usage.

Built-in functions are functions that are included in Python's standard library and can be called directly without importing any external modules. Built-in functions have a specific name and syntax that must be followed in order to use them. For example, the `len()` function is a built-in function that returns the length of a sequence. To use it, you simply call the function and pass the sequence as an argument:

```python
s = "hello"
print(len(s)) # output: 5
```

Built-in methods, on the other hand, are methods that are associated with specific data types (e.g. strings, lists, etc.) and can be called on instances of those data types. Built-in methods have a specific syntax that must be followed in order to use them. For example, the `split()` method is a built-in method that can be called on a string to split it into a list of substrings. To use it, you call the method on the string instance and pass the delimiter as an argument:

```python
s = "hello,world"
words = s.split(",")
print(words) # output: ['hello', 'world']
```

The main difference between built-in functions and built-in methods is that built-in functions can operate on any data type or object, whereas built-in methods only apply to specific data types or objects. Another difference is that built-in methods are called on instances of objects, whereas built-in functions are called directly.

In general, built-in methods are more specific and tailored to the data type they operate on, whereas built-in functions are more generic and can be used with a wider range of data types and objects.

Both built-in functions and methods are useful in different situations, and it's important to know when to use each one.

Python provides a large number of built-in functions and methods. Here are some examples:

## Built-in Functions:
- print(): This function is used to display output to the console.
- input(): This function is used to get input from the user.
- len(): This function is used to get the length of a sequence (e.g. a string, list, or tuple).
- type(): This function is used to get the data type of a variable.
## Built-in Methods:
- append(): This method is used to add an element to the end of a list.
- split(): This method is used to split a string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter.
- join(): This method is used to join a list of strings into a single string, with a specified delimiter.
- upper(): This method is used to convert a string to uppercase.
- sort(): This method is used to sort a list in ascending order.

Here are some examples of using built-in functions and methods:

# using built-in functions
```python
s = input("Enter the words: ")

print(len(s)) # output: 13

print(type(s)) # output: <class 'str'>
```

# using built-in methods
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("orange")
print(fruits) # output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']

s = "apple,banana,cherry"
fruits = s.split(",")
print(fruits) # output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

s = "-".join(fruits)
print(s) # output: 'apple-banana-cherry'

s = "hello, world!"
print(s.upper()) # output: 'HELLO, WORLD!'

numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
numbers.sort()
print(numbers) # output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 9]
```
