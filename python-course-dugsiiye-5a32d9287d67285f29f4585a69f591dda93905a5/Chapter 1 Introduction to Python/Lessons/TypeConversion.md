Type conversion, also known as typecasting, is the process of converting a value from one data type to another. Python provides several built-in functions for type conversion, which can be particularly useful when working with user input, or when performing operations that involve different data types.

Here are some examples of type conversion in Python:

1. Converting between numeric types:

```python
x = 5
y = float(x) # converting integer to float
z = int(y) # converting float to integer
print(x, y, z) # output: 5, 5.0, 5
```

In this example, we're using the `float()` and `int()` functions to convert an integer to a float and back to an integer.

2. Converting between string and numeric types:

```python
s = "123"
x = int(s) # converting string to integer
y = float(s) # converting string to float
z = str(x) # converting integer to string
print(s, x, y, z) # output: "123", 123, 123.0, "123"
```

In this example, we're using the `int()` and `float()` functions to convert a string containing a number to an integer or float, and the `str()` function to convert an integer back to a string.

3. Converting between sequence types:

```python
s = "hello"
lst = list(s) # converting string to list
tpl = tuple(lst) # converting list to tuple
print(s, lst, tpl) # output: "hello", ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'], ('h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o')
```

In this example, we're using the `list()` and `tuple()` functions to convert a string to a list and then to a tuple.

These are just a few examples of the many ways you can perform type conversion in Python. Depending on your application, you may need to use additional type conversion functions or methods to perform specific operations or conversions.
